How do you do.,Green
"I believe in you, no matter what happens",Green
"I’m here for you, no matter what",Green
You’ve got this,Green
YOU are the prize!,Green
You are the master of your own destiny,Green
"Hey, you are my hero. You pulled it together when I needed you most. Thank you",Green
What you did took some serious bravery. I’m really proud of you,Green
Look at me… Take a deep breath in… now out…,Green
Everything will work out the way it is supposed to.,Green
You never know what gifts life can give you in moments of real need. Keep your eyes open for them,Green
"You did great; after all, you did your best, and that’s what constitutes greatness in my eyes.",Green
"Don’t give up when dark times come. The more storms you face in life, the stronger you’ll be. Hold on. Your greater is coming",Green
"The sky is everywhere, it begins at your feet",Green
Stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy,Green
I’ve got nothing to do today but smile,Green
"Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I.",Green
"Let us be of good cheer, however, remembering that the misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never come",Green
"Laugh now, cry later",Green
"Cheer up, my dear. After every storm comes the sun. Happiness is waiting for you ahead",Green
"Once they move, they’re gone. Once you move, life starts over again",Green
It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,Green
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,Green
"My entire life can be described in one sentence: It didn’t go as planned, and that’s okay",Green
The best of healers is good cheer,Green
Turn adversity into triumph,Green
For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness,Green
"No matter how you feel, get up, dress up, show up, and never give up",Green
"Right now you can cry to your heart’s content. But trust me, someday you will wake and forget about him",Green
Life is not a problem to be solved but a gift to be enjoyed,Green
The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up,Green
There’s something in you that the world needs,Green
Be positive. Stay happy and don’t let the negativity of the world get you down,Green
Don’t deny your feelings. They alone are what guide you through life,Green
"You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think",Green
Reminder that Winnie the Pooh wore a crop top w/ no panties and ate his fave food and love himself and u can too,Green
"When you are feeling sad, just remember that somewhere in the world, there’s a moron pushing a door that said pull",Green
Don’t be sad because of people. They will all die,Green
"Five Ups of life: Buckle up, Start up, Keep it up, Don’t give up, Cheer up",Green
"We are very near the end, but have not and will not lose our good cheer",Green
"Enjoy the little things and be joyful, for one day you may look back and realize they were actually the things that mattered",Green
We are our choices,Green
"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking",Green
Everything you want is on the other side of fear,Green
"Cheer up, the worst is yet to come",Green
"It is the hopeful, buoyant, cheerful attitude of mind that wins. Optimism is a success builder, pessimism an achievement killer",Green
"Our greatest glory is not in ever failing, but in rising every time we fail",Green
"I know you, you are awesome, you are strong and you will be able to make things better",Green
Life is too short for us to dwell on sadness. Cheer up and live life to the fullest,Green
You’ll never find a rainbow if you’re looking down,Green
"Whoever is trying to bring you down, is already below you",Green
You are awesome! Never forget that,Green
"Forget what’s gone, appreciate what remains, and look forward what’s coming next",Green
"Remember that sometimes, not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck",Green
Being happy doesn’t mean that everything is perfect. It simply means that you’ve decided to look beyond the imperfections of life,Green
The people who are always trying to cheer others up are unhappy themselves,Green
"Always remember, you are braver than you believe. Stronger than you seem. Smarter than you think. And twice as beautiful as you’d ever imagined",Green
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity,Green
"Cheer up, buttercup. Storms don’t last forever",Green
Life is not a waste as long as there is at least one person in the world who cares for you. So when things go wrong and you feel like giving up – remember you’ve got me,Green
"Stay positive, work hard, and make it happen",Green
"Winners are not people who never fail, but people who never quit",Green
Beautiful. Definition: A person who is reading this,Green
You are confined only by the walls you build yourself,Green
"You don’t always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go and see what happens",Green
"God will not give you a burden you can’t handle. So, if you find yourself in a mess that’s impossible to resolve, take this challenge as a compliment",Green
Sometimes you have to just pick yourself up and carry on,Green
Sometimes the reason good things are not happening to you is because you are the good thing that needs to happen to other people,Green
"An original is worth more than a copy, so be yourself",Green
If “Plan A” didn’t work. The alphabet has 25 more letters! Stay cool,Green
"Cheer up, tomorrow is another chance",Green
Stars can’t shine without darkness,Green
 Life is better when you’re laughing,Green

"After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem, there is a solution, and the soul’s indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer",Green
The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up,Green
"The energy you give off is the energy you receive. I really think that, so I’m always myself – jumping, dancing, singing around, trying to cheer everybody up",Green

The purpose of our lives is to be happy,Green
"The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate",Green
The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up,Green

I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve,Green

Under the weather,Yellow
Right as rain,Yellow
Take a rain check,Yellow
Head in the clouds,Yellow
Every cloud has a silver lining,Yellow
The calm before the storm,Yellow
"Red sky at night, sailor’s delight",Yellow
Rainbow in the morning gives you fair warning,Yellow
"When dew is on the grass, rain will never come to pass",Yellow
Mares’ tails and mackerel scales make tall ships take in their sails,Yellow
Dog days of summer,Yellow
It’s raining cats and dogs,Yellow
Afraid of thunderstorms?,Yellow
Like to dance in the rain?,Yellow
Find lightning beautiful?,Yellow
"Every year, storms roll across our cities—rain storms, snow storms, hail storms, etc.",Yellow
So what’s the weather like in your city today?,Yellow
"We’ll be talking about terms you need to describe those sunny days, stormy days, and all those in between.",Yellow
"When the weather is warm, I prefer light clothing like t-shirts.",Yellow
Today is so hot that I’ve been sitting under the fan all day.,Yellow
"On cool days like today, you should be fine with a light jacket.",Yellow
Don’t forget your coat; it’s cold outside.,Yellow
"On sunny days, I like to take the kids to the beach.",Yellow
Rainy days are the best time to stay home and read a book.,Yellow
Isn’t it great that we’re having such clear days this week?,Yellow
It looks cloudy; you should bring an umbrella in case it rains.,Yellow
Bush fires are common around here when the weather is dry.,Yellow
The weather’s been so humid lately it’s impossible to go outside without breaking a sweat.,Yellow
Be sure to turn on your headlights when driving through foggy areas.,Yellow
It’s misty up in the mountains in the mornings.,Yellow
It’s been gusty all afternoon and my umbrella was blown away.,Yellow
"As we were walking along the beach, it started to get windy.",Yellow
"Whenever there’s thunder and lightning, my dog rushes into the house in fear.",Yellow
It’s around 40°.,Yellow
It’s warm and windy outside.,Yellow
There’s nothing but blue skies outside.,Yellow
We couldn’t ask for nicer weather this week!,Yellow
This is the most beautiful weather we’ve had all week!,Yellow
This is the worst weather we’ve had all spring! ,Yellow
"Nasty weather today, isn’t it? ",Yellow
Heavy rain seems to be heading this way.,Yellow
The weather will be cooling down soon.,Yellow
"Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume. Everyone everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea.",Yellow
"If you really think that the environment is less important than the economy, try holding your breath while you count your money",Yellow
"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything",Yellow
One of the biggest obstacles to making a start on climate change is that it has become a cliché before it has even been understood,Yellow
"Twenty-five years ago, people could be excused for not knowing much, or doing much, about climate change. Today we have no excuse",Yellow
"Climate change is the environmental challenge of this generation, and it is imperative that we act before it’s too late",Yellow
"Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth… these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security, and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all",Yellow
We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children,Yellow
"We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it",Yellow
"All things share the same breath – the beast, the tree, the man. The air shares its spirit with all the life it supports",Yellow
"We must face up to an inescapable reality: the challenges of sustainability simply overwhelm the adequacy of our responses. With some honorable exceptions, our responses are too few, too little, and too late",Yellow
"Climate change is happening, humans are causing it, and I think this is perhaps the most serious environmental issue facing us",Yellow
"Climate change is sometimes misunderstood as being about changes in the weather. In reality, it is about changes in our very way of life",Yellow
"A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people",Yellow
"Climate change does not respect border; it does not respect who you are – rich and poor, small and big. Therefore, this is what we call ‘global challenges,’ which require global solidarity",Yellow
"Wind and other clean, renewable energy will help end our reliance on fossil fuels and combat the severe threat that climate change poses to humans and wildlife alike",Yellow
"If we pollute the air, water and soil that keep us alive and well, and destroy the biodiversity that allows natural systems to function, no amount of money will save us",Yellow
We can be thankful President Barack Obama is taking aim at one of the prime causes of climate change and extreme weather: air pollution. The EPA’s carbon pollution standards are the most significant step forward our country has ever taken to protect our health by addressing climate change,Yellow
"The cost of our success is the exhaustion of natural resources, leading to energy crises, climate change, pollution, and the destruction of our habitat. If you exhaust natural resources, there will be nothing left for your children. If we continue in the same direction, humankind is headed for some frightful ordeals, if not extinction",Yellow
"Climate change, in some regions, has aggravated conflict over scarce land, and could well trigger large-scale migration in the decades ahead. And rising sea levels put at risk the very survival of all small island states. These and other implications for peace and security have implications for the United Nations itself",Yellow
"When all the world appears to be in a tumult, and nature itself is feeling the assault of climate change, the seasons retain their essential rhythm. Yes, fall gives us a premonition of winter, but then, winter will be forced to relent, once again, to the new beginnings of soft greens, longer light, and the sweet air of spring",Yellow
"If you don’t act against climate change, then no matter how much money you leave for your children, it’ll not even cover their healthcare bills, due to living in an unhealthy planet",Yellow
"I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue – it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well",Yellow
"As human beings, we are vulnerable to confusing the unprecedented with the improbable. In our everyday experience, if something has never happened before, we are generally safe in assuming it is not going to happen in the future, but the exceptions can kill you, and climate change is one of those exceptions",Yellow
"Climate change is a global problem. The planet is warming because of the growing level of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. If this trend continues, truly catastrophic consequences are likely to ensue from rising sea levels to reduced water availability, to more heat waves and fires",Yellow
There is no question that climate change is happening; the only arguable point is what part humans are playing in it,Yellow
"The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way. But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact",Yellow
"The world that you and I live in is increasingly challenged. Population growth, pollution, over-consumption, unsustainable patterns, social conflict, climate change, loss of nature… these are not good stories",Yellow
Climate change is destroying our path to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course,Yellow
"Anybody who doesn’t see the impact of climate change is really, and I would say, myopic. They don’t see the reality. It’s so evident that we are destroying Mother Earth. This is not the problem of one country or a few countries: it is the problem of mankind. We need to work together to stop this. Otherwise, our future generations will simply disappear",Yellow
The warnings about global warming have been extremely clear for a long time. We are facing a global climate crisis. It is deepening. We are entering a period of consequences,Yellow
"We are all living together on a single planet, which is threatened by our own actions. And if you don’t have some kind of global cooperation, nationalism is just not on the right level to tackle the problems, whether it’s climate change or whether it’s technological disruption",Yellow
"The clear and present danger of climate change means we cannot burn our way to prosperity. We already rely too heavily on fossil fuels and we need to find a new, sustainable path to the future we want. We need a clean industrial revolution",Yellow
"Climate change, if unchecked, is an urgent threat to health, food supplies, biodiversity, and livelihoods across the globe",Yellow
Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen We risk damages on a scale larger than the two world wars of the last century,Yellow
"By the time we see that climate change is really bad, your ability to fix it is extremely limited… The carbon gets up there, but the heating effect is delayed. And then the effect of that heat on the species and ecosystem is delayed. That means that even when you turn virtuous, things are actually going to get worse for quite a while",Yellow
"I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems. I believe mankind has looked at climate change in the same way, as if it were fiction",Yellow
"We can’t take climate change and put it on the back burner. If we don’t address climate change, we won’t be around as humans",Yellow
"We cannot compromise with the earth; we cannot compromise with the catastrophe of unchecked climate change, so we must compromise with one another",Yellow
"To put it in more shocking terms, it doesn’t matter if the skeptics are right or not, because the assumptions on which the debate is based are already enough to doom us to a dystopian future",Yellow
"The general population doesn’t know what’s happening, and it doesn’t even know that it doesn’t know",Yellow
The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for,Yellow
We are living on this planet as if we had another one to go to,Yellow
"I’d be stunned, shocked, and amazed if there were a human being on the planet in 2030",Yellow
The Earth should not be a worse place after my life than it was when I was born here,Yellow
"God gave us the earth, to till and to keep in a balanced and respectful way",Yellow
"Climate change is the most severe problem that we are facing today, more serious even than the threat of terrorism",Yellow
A planet being pushed to the edge will eventually turn on us,Yellow
The planet will continue to cook,Yellow
Climatism is the belief that man-made greenhouse gases are destroying Earth’s climate,Yellow
"The facts are there that we have created, man has, a self-inflicted wound that man has created through global warming",Yellow
"We are running out of time, and we must have a planetary solution to a planetary crisis",Yellow
The future will be green or not at all,Yellow
"There is no such thing as ‘away’. So, when we throw anything away, it must go somewhere",Yellow
